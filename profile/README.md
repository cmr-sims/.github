There have been many implementations of the context maintenance and retrieval model since its introduction by Polyn, Norman, and Kahana in 2009. This organization collects information about these various implementations in one place.

# MATLAB

## CMR

The UPenn Computational Memory Lab website hosts an [archive](https://memory.psych.upenn.edu/CMR) of the original MATLAB implementation of CMR.

Polyn, S. M., Norman, K. A. and Kahana, M. J. (2009) A context maintenance and retrieval model of organizational processes in free recall. Psychological Review, 116 (1), 129-156. 

## CMR Matlab

The [CMR-Matlab](https://github.com/cmr-sims/cmr-matlab) project includes MATLAB implementations of multiple versions of CMR.

# Python

## CyMR

The [CyMR](https://github.com/cmr-sims/cymr) Python package includes a fast implementation of likelihood-based CMR written using Cython. The [CMR-CFR](https://github.com/vucml/cmr_cfr) project uses this code to simulate categorized free recall and data from the PEERS study.

# Contributing

If you would like to contribute information about a CMR implementation or add a code repository, contact one of the organization [owners](https://github.com/orgs/cmr-sims/people?query=role%3Aowner) to get access. Links to implementations can be added to this file, which is displayed on the organization home page. Please include a summary describing the type of model implemented, and a reference to any papers published using that implementation. Code repositories can also be added under the organization; they should also be referenced in the above model implementation index.
