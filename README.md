There have been many implementations of the context maintenance and retrieval model since the introduction of the temporal context model upon which it is based.

* [CMR](https://memory.psych.upenn.edu/CMR) - Matlab implementation of CMR
* [CMR_sims](https://github.com/vucml/CMR_sims) - includes Matlab implementations of multiple versions of CMR
* [CyMR](https://github.com/mortonne/cymr) - fast Python implementation of likelihood-based CMR
