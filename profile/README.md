There have been many implementations of the context maintenance and retrieval model since the introduction of the temporal context model upon which it is based.

# MATLAB

## CMR

The UPenn Computational Memory Lab website hosts an [archive](https://memory.psych.upenn.edu/CMR) of the original MATLAB implementation of CMR.

## CMR_Sims

The [CMR_Sims](https://github.com/vucml/CMR_sims) project includes Matlab implementations of multiple versions of CMR.

# Python

## CyMR

The [CyMR](https://github.com/mortonne/cymr) Python package includes a fast implementation of likelihood-based CMR written using Cython. The [CMR-CFR](https://github.com/vucml/cmr_cfr) project uses this code to simulate categorized free recall and data from the PEERS study.
